Architecture 5

Great — here’s a deeply analyzed and fully developed login flow & registration flow for My Campus school management app, based on my architecture and multi-role structure.

A.✅ CAMPUS APP – COMPLETE LOGIN FLOW (Aligned with Registration)

🔐 1. Login Entry Screen

When users open the app and click “Login”, they are taken to a screen where they choose their role:
	•	👨‍🎓 Student
	•	👨‍👩‍👧 Parent
        •	🏫 School
	•	🌍 Guest
	 
Each role leads to a slightly different login process based on what data they must input and what access level they need.

👨‍🎓 2. STUDENT LOGIN FLOW

UI:
	•	Email / Username / Phone Number
	•	Password
	•	👁 Show/Hide password toggle
	•	🔄 Forgot password?
	•	✅ Remember me (toggle)

Logic:
	•	Validate login credentials
	•	Check school match (if registered under a school)
	•	If first login → redirect to student onboarding (e.g., profile completion)
	•	If returning → redirect to student dashboard

👩‍👦 3. PARENT LOGIN FLOW

UI:
	•	Email / Username / Phone Number
	•	Password
	•	👁 Show/Hide password toggle
	•	🔄 Forgot password?
	•	✅ Remember me (toggle)
	•	Optional: Child’s School Code (if not already linked)

Logic:
	•	Validate login
	•	If linked to student(s), load parent dashboard with:
	•	Attendance
	•	Fees
	•	Progress
	•	If not linked → prompt to link child via:
	•	Unique student code
	•	QR Code (for easy linking)
	•	Or pending approval by school admin

🌍 4. GUEST LOGIN FLOW


UI:
        •        info of continuing as guest and all
	•	One-tap “Continue as Guest”
	•	(like a very developed social media but of schools)


Logic:
	•	No password needed
	•	Limited access to view:

🏫 5. SCHOOL LOGIN FLOW

Step 1 – Role Prompt:

When user selects “School”, show:
	•	🔘 Create a new school account
	•	🔘 Login to existing school
 

🆕 Option A: Create New School Account
	•	Redirects to Registration Wizard (handled in plan dawn)

🔐 Option B: Login to Existing School

UI:
	•	Email / Username / Phone Number
	•	Password
	•	👁 Show/Hide password toggle
	•	🔄 Forgot password?
	•	✅ Remember me (toggle)


Logic:
	•	School is identified by domain/email/name
	•	If user not yet linked, deny or request admin approval
	•	If login valid:
	•	lands or link → dashboard according to how or role or field the account was registered 

🔐 6. SECURITY & MANAGEMENT

Security Measures:
	•	✅ Encrypted passwords (bcrypt or Argon2)
	•	✅ Email/phone OTP for account recovery
	•	✅ Device detection alerts
	•	✅ Login history (per user)
	•	✅ JWT or Session Tokens (auto-expiry with refresh)
	•	✅ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
	•	✅ Admins can suspend users or revoke login permissions
🧠 7. UX Best Practices
	•	🎨 Use clear and simple forms
	•	🧭 Smooth transitions (wizard-style for new schools)
	•	🛎 Smart error messages (e.g., “Wrong password” vs “Account not found”)
	•	📲 Support biometric login for mobile (later phase)
	•	📌 Save last used login role for quick access
	•	🔄 Auto-refresh tokens behind the scenes

B. 🔐 Role-Based Registration Entry (Step 1)

✅ “Who are you?” Options:
	•	🎓 Student
	•	👨‍👩‍👧 Parent
	•	🌐 Guest
	•	🏫 School Staff / Admin

This is implemented using role-based authentication wizards, which dynamically adjust the next steps.

🧩 2. Dynamic Wizard Flow per role(Step 2)

Each option leads to a separate registration flow. Here’s how:
