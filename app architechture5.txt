Architecture 5

Great — here’s a deeply analyzed and fully developed login flow & registration flow for My Campus school management app, based on my architecture and multi-role structure.

A.✅ CAMPUS APP – COMPLETE LOGIN FLOW (Aligned with Registration)

🔐 1. Login Entry Screen

When users open the app and click “Login”, they are taken to a screen where they choose their role:
	•	👨‍🎓 Student
	•	👨‍👩‍👧 Parent
	•	🌍 Guest
	•	🏫 School (school-Admin (orfounder)/Teacher/Other Staff)

Each role leads to a slightly different login process based on what data they must input and what access level they need.

👨‍🎓 2. STUDENT LOGIN FLOW

UI:
	•	Email / Username / Phone Number
	•	Password
	•	👁 Show/Hide password toggle
	•	🔄 Forgot password?
	•	✅ Remember me (toggle)

Logic:
	•	Validate login credentials
	•	Check school match (if registered under a school)
	•	If first login → redirect to student onboarding (e.g., profile completion)
	•	If returning → redirect to student dashboard

👩‍👦 3. PARENT LOGIN FLOW

UI:
	•	Email / Phone
	•	Password
	•	Optional: Child’s School Code (if not already linked)

Logic:
	•	Validate login
	•	If linked to student(s), load parent dashboard with:
	•	Attendance
	•	Fees
	•	Progress
	•	If not linked → prompt to link child via:
	•	Unique student code
	•	QR Code (for easy linking)
	•	Or pending approval by school admin

🌍 4. GUEST LOGIN FLOW

Purpose:

Let people (inspectors, future school clients, etc.) explore a demo mode.

UI:
	•	One-tap “Continue as Guest”
	•	Optional school selector (to view demo data)

Logic:
	•	No password needed
	•	Limited access to view:
	•	Sample classes
	•	Calendar
	•	Events

🏫 5. SCHOOL LOGIN FLOW

Step 1 – Role Prompt:

When user selects “School”, show:
	•	🔘 Create a new school account
	•	🔘 Login to existing school

🆕 Option A: Create New School Account
	•	Redirects to Registration Wizard (handled in earlier plan)

🔐 Option B: Login to Existing School

UI:
	•	Dropdown or autocomplete input for school name or school email
	•	User email (admin/teacher/staff)
	•	Password
	•	Login as:
	•	🧑‍💼 School Admin
	•	🧑‍🏫 Teacher
	•	🧑‍🔧 Support Staff (IT, Accountant, etc.)

Logic:
	•	School is identified by domain/email/name
	•	If user not yet linked, deny or request admin approval
	•	If login valid:
	•	Admins → Admin dashboard (full control)
	•	Teachers → Classroom + Student data
	•	Staff → Role-specific dashboards (e.g., accountant sees finance)

🔐 6. SECURITY & MANAGEMENT

Security Measures:
	•	✅ Encrypted passwords (bcrypt or Argon2)
	•	✅ Email/phone OTP for account recovery
	•	✅ Device detection alerts
	•	✅ Login history (per user)
	•	✅ JWT or Session Tokens (auto-expiry with refresh)
	•	✅ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
	•	✅ Admins can suspend users or revoke login permissions
🧠 7. UX Best Practices
	•	🎨 Use clear and simple forms
	•	🧭 Smooth transitions (wizard-style for new schools)
	•	🛎 Smart error messages (e.g., “Wrong password” vs “Account not found”)
	•	📲 Support biometric login for mobile (later phase)
	•	📌 Save last used login role for quick access
	•	🔄 Auto-refresh tokens behind the scenes

B. 🔐 Role-Based Registration Entry (Step 1)

✅ “Who are you?” Options:
	•	🎓 Student
	•	👨‍👩‍👧 Parent
	•	🌐 Guest
	•	🏫 School Staff / Admin

This is implemented using role-based authentication wizards, which dynamically adjust the next steps.

🧩 2. Dynamic Wizard Flow per Role (Step 2)

Each option leads to a separate flow. Here’s how:

🎓 Student Flow
	•	Step 1: Full Name, Age, Gender
	•	Step 2: Choose School (dropdown or search, or enter manually)
	•	Step 3: Class / Section selection
	•	Step 4: Create Account (Phone/Email + Password or OTP-based)
	•	Step 5: Parent Link (optional): Send invite to parent’s phone/email

✅ Auto-link to student School Dashboard after verification

👨‍👩‍👧 Parent Flow
	•	Step 1: Name, Gender, Relationship to Student
	•	Step 2: Phone number or Email
	•	Step 3: Link to child (via unique code, student name+school+class, or invite)
	•	Step 4: Create Password / OTP
	•	Step 5: Terms & Confirm

✅ Parents will see only their children’s progress, messages, ... etc

🌐 Guest Flow
	•	Step 1: Name (optional)
	•	Step 2: Select Area/School of Interest (search or browse)
	•	Step 3: View limited public info (news, events, gallery)

✅ No login required unless they want to interact
✅ Guest session expires after 7 days

🏫 School Flow (Admin/Staff/Teacher)

➤ After choosing “School” role:

	System asks:

	•	✅ Do you want to:
	•	➕ Create a New School
	•	🔐 Log into an Existing School Account

➕ Create a New School Account
	•	Step 1: Enter school name, motto, region, address
	•	Step 2: Add primary school email
	•	Step 3: Phone number + OTP
	•	Step 4: Set admin password
	•	Step 5: Upload logo, select type (Nursery, Primary, Secondary, etc.)
	•	Step 6: Security: Choose recovery questions + PIN
	•	Step 7: Agreement to terms and policy
	•	✅ Automatically land in the school-Admin dashboard

🔐 Log into an Existing School
	•	Step 1: Choose school by name or enter code/email
	•	Step 2: Select role (Admin / Teacher / Staff)
	•	Step 3: Enter School-issued email or ID
	•	Step 4: Enter password / OTP
	•	Step 5: Verify with security question or device

✅ Access is role-limited (e.g., Teachers don’t see finances)

🧠 Backend Role & Security Management
	•	JWT + Role-based access control (RBAC)
	•	School-specific tenant logic (multi-tenant database)
	•	Logs & auditing for all login attempts
	•	Data encryption for school data, separated per tenant
	•	Admins can approve/revoke accounts in their school

🌅 Visual Layout & UX

Each flow uses a clean, friendly wizard design with:
	•	Animated transitions
	•	Progress indicators (Step 1 of 4, etc.)
	•	Icons and illustrations
	•	Voice guidance for low-literacy users
	•	Back/Continue navigation
	•	Haptic + Notification feedback
